## Quiz System Implementation

The quiz system is fully implemented and functional. Here's how it works:

### Quiz Creation Flow
1. **Module Quiz**: Student selects a module → System randomly selects 10 questions from QuestionBank → Creates Quiz and QuizQuestion records → Creates QuizAttempt with "in_progress" status
2. **Timed Exam**: Student selects modules and time limit → System randomly selects questions → Creates custom quiz
3. **Adaptive Test**: Student selects difficulty → System selects questions based on difficulty level

### Quiz Taking Flow
1. Student navigates to quiz taking page with `attemptId`
2. System fetches quiz questions from `QuizQuestion` table
3. Student answers questions → Each answer is saved to `AnswerRecord` table via `/api/quiz/submit-answer`
4. Timer counts down (15 minutes for module quiz)
5. Student clicks "Submit Quiz" → Calls `/api/quiz/attempt/:attemptId/finish`

## Docker Setup (Recommended)
This project is fully dockerized. To start all services (frontend, backend, database):
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
See [DOCKERIZATION.md](./DOCKERIZATION.md) for detailed instructions and common commands.

## Getting Started (Local Development)
### Scoring System
1. **Answer Validation**: Each answer is compared to `correctAnswer` in `QuestionBank` (case-insensitive)
2. **Points Calculation**: Correct answers earn points (default 1 point per question)
3. **Final Score**: Calculated as `(totalPointsEarned / totalPossiblePoints) * 100`
4. **Pass/Fail**: Determined by comparing score to `passingScore` (default 60%)
5. **Results Include**:
   - Final score percentage
   - Correct/incorrect/skipped question counts
   - Time spent
   - Question breakdown by type (MCQ, Labeling, Drag & Drop)
   - Detailed question review with explanations

### Database Schema Notes
- **QuestionBank**: Stores all available questions (no `moduleId` or `questionText` columns in current schema)
- **Quiz**: Stores quiz instances (basic schema: `moduleId`, `timeLimit`, `totalQuestions`, `passingScore`)
- **QuizQuestion**: Links questions to quizzes, stores `questionText` (retrieved from existing records or generated)
- **QuizAttempt**: Tracks student attempts with status (`in_progress`, `completed`, `abandoned`)
- **AnswerRecord**: Stores individual answers with correctness and points earned

### Key Features
- ✅ Random question selection from QuestionBank
- ✅ Real-time answer submission
- ✅ Automatic timer with auto-submit
- ✅ Score calculation and pass/fail determination
- ✅ Detailed results with question-by-question breakdown
- ✅ Question text retrieval from existing QuizQuestion records
- ✅ Support for multiple question types (MCQ, Labeling, Drag & Drop)

## Next Targets: Frontend-Backend Integration

The following frontend pages need to be connected to backend APIs (currently using mock data or not fetching from backend):

### Student Screens
- **StudentDashboard** - Connect to `/api/dashboard` endpoints for stats, recent modules, activity, and deadlines
- **StudentAnalytics** - Connect to `/api/analytics/student` for detailed analytics data
- **ModulesList** - Connect to `/api/modules` for available modules and stats
- **ModuleExploration** - Connect to `/api/explore/:moduleId` endpoints for details, bookmarks, notes, interactions, chat, and progress
- **QuizSelection** - ✅ **FULLY INTEGRATED** - Connected to `/api/quiz/modules`, `/api/quiz/stats`, and `/api/quiz/attempts`
- **QuizTaking** - ✅ **FULLY INTEGRATED** - Connected to `/api/quiz/attempt/:attemptId` for questions, `/api/quiz/submit-answer` for answers, and `/api/quiz/attempt/:attemptId/finish` for submission
- **QuizResult** - ✅ **FULLY INTEGRATED** - Connected to `/api/quiz/attempt/:attemptId` for detailed results with scores and question breakdown

### Instructor Screens
- **InstructorDashboard** - Connect to `/api/dashboard` endpoints 
- **InstructorManageStudents** - Connect to `/api/user` endpoints for student management (may require additional instructor-specific APIs)

### Admin Screens
- **AdminDashboard** - Connect to `/api/dashboard` endpoints (may require admin-specific data and additional admin APIs)

### Additional Pages (Not Routed)
- **AssignModule** - Implement backend connection for module assignment functionality (likely requires new API endpoints)

## 3D Model Viewing Progress

The 3D model viewing functionality has been implemented with the following features:

### ThreeViewer Component (`frontend/src/pages/ThreeViewer.tsx`)
- **3D Rendering**: Uses Three.js library for WebGL-based 3D rendering
- **Model Loading**: Supports FBX format models (e.g., SkeletalSystem100.fbx in `frontend/public/models/`)
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Mouse drag to rotate the model
  - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out (with bounds: 50-800 units)
  - Click on model parts to select/highlight them
  - Hover over parts to display part names in a tooltip
- **Loading & Error Handling**:
  - Loading progress indicator with percentage
  - Error display for failed model loads
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Script loading caching to avoid redundant downloads
  - Pixel ratio limiting for better performance
  - Memory cleanup for geometries, materials, and renderer

### Test Page (`frontend/src/pages/testmodel.tsx`)
- Dedicated page for testing 3D model viewing functionality
- Integrates the ThreeViewer component with sample model path

### Current Status
- Basic 3D model loading and rendering
- Interactive rotation and zooming
- Part selection and highlighting
- Hover tooltips for part names

### Next Steps
- Add camera presets or viewpoints
- More interactivity
- Connect to backend for dynamic model loading based on modules
- Expanding and manipulating using physics


### Quiz System Notes
- Questions are stored in the `QuestionBank` table
- When creating quizzes, the system randomly selects questions
- Question text is retrieved from existing `QuizQuestion` records if available
- If no existing question text is found, it generates a placeholder based on the topic
- All quiz attempts are tracked in `QuizAttempt` with status and scores
- Answers are stored in `AnswerRecord` with correctness validation
