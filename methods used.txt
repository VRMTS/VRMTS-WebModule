1. Auto-Scaling
scale = 200 / max(size.x, size.y, size.z)
Used for: Normalize model size to fit viewport

2. Degrees to Radians
radians = degrees × (π / 180)
Used for: Convert camera FOV to radians for trigonometric calculations

3. Camera Distance from FOV
distance = (max_dimension / 2) / tan(FOV / 2) × 2.0
Used for: Calculate how far camera should be to frame object

4. Zoom Percentage
percentage = (800 - zoom_level) / 7.5
Used for: Display zoom as intuitive percentage

5. Screen to NDC Conversion
NDC_x = ((pixel_x - offset_x) / width) × 2 - 1
NDC_y = -((pixel_y - offset_y) / height) × 2 + 1
Used for: Convert mouse pixels to 3D coordinate system for raycasting

6. Rotation Accumulation
rotation_y = rotation_y + (mouse_delta_x × 0.01)
rotation_x = rotation_x + (mouse_delta_y × 0.01)
Used for: Rotate scene based on mouse drag

7. Clamped Zoom
new_zoom = max(50, min(800, current_zoom + scroll_delta × 0.1))
Used for: Zoom with scroll wheel within bounds

8. Direction Vector
D = P_object - P_center
D_normalized = D / √(x² + y² + z²)
Used for: Calculate direction from center to object for explosion

9. Explosion Offset
offset = direction × slider_value × 0.05
P_new = P_original + offset
Used for: Move parts radially outward

10. Vector Length Squared
|V|² = x² + y² + z²
Used for: Check if vector is zero-length (avoid division by zero)

11. Spherical Distribution (Fibonacci Sphere)
φ = arccos(-1 + 2i/N)
θ = √(N × π) × φ
x = cos(θ) × sin(φ)
y = sin(θ) × sin(φ)
z = cos(φ)
Used for: Evenly distribute objects on sphere when direction is ambiguous
